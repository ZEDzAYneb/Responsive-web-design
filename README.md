# FreeCodeCamp


In this Responsive Web Design Certification, i learned the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, i learned the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, i learned modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility.

Finally, i learned how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes , and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.

## Responsive Web Design Projects

To put my newly learnt skills to work. I worked on these projects, to get a chance to apply all of the skills, principles, and concepts i have learned so far: HTML, CSS, Visual Design, Accessibility, and more.

I completed the five web programming projects to earn my Responsive Web Design certification.
